# LZ77-DEFLATE
This project compare source.txt using LZ77 algorithm and Deflate(LZ77+HUFFMAN) Algorithm, so if you want run this code be sure source.txt and main.c are in same directory

##### This project has been developed using the C programming language #####

this project compares lz77 and deflate algorithms on the same text as time and compression ratio

Run : change text in source.txt with any text as u want and run main.c 

Program results will be published in console also u can find the text after lz77 algorithm in encoded.txt and the text after Deflate algorithm in DeflateEncode.txt
